My favorites are from Nintendo, but I play everything. Video games will be something that even though the years go by I will continue playing.",
                    "Anime is something that my brothers have included in me since I was a child, so I have normalized it a lot in my life. It is something super natural for me and away from the taboo, it is a very consumed product in my family. There are animes that have marked me and I consider they have many brilliant proposals for the world of entertainment. I also think that they have influenced a lot from the culture of western animation.",
