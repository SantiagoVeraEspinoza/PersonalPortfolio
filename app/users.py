The website was designed to provide users with an easy and secure way to manage their personal information and privacy preferences',

This involved creating a collision detection system, implementing efficient rendering of sprites and animations (all of which were custom), and optimizing the game to achieve up to 60 consistent frames per second. Everything with a header only game engine that literally just gave me the ability to display pixels on screen and manage frames',
